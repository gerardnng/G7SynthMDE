-----A model Driven Engineering project for Grafcet synthesis on multy targets------
This repository content :
- The GrafcetModeling project with its useful plugins for the Grafcet metamodeling
- The GrafcetExpression2 project for the implementation of a Grafcet expressions parser with ANTLR Eclipse plugins
- The G7MM2Arduino project for the transformation of any Grafcet model to an Arduino code (M2T transformation) using the Acceleo language and Acceleo Eclipse plugin
- The G7MMToCode project for the transformation of any Grafcet model associated to a microcontroller (C-programmable) model to a code in the C-language of this microcontroller. 
  The transformation is also programmed in Acceleo.
